    [ ] For $options['extra']: Have a symf. form type extension for having it everywhere ?
        » would permit having things such as 'narratives', 'tooltip', etc.. to be available
          everywhere...

    [ ] collection: true >> form extension for handling « at least M, at most N, exactly X »
        OR: can this be achieved with constraints ??

    [ ] Have some kind of scoped symbol table for looking up drops up the hierarchy of content types.
        e.g. @:nationalities  ==>  ScopedSymbolTable->lookup('nationalities') ?
